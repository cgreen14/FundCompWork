In the final part of the lab the goal was to use the data about the win 
loss record of the Notre Dame football team, since 1900, to further our 
understanding of functions as well as arrays.  From the user perspective 
they simply follow the command prompts to select how they would like to 
search through the data.  This includes, win - loss for every year, as 
well as years with x wins or losses, and a list of the best years or 
worst years that we have had as a program. 

Interally, it functions by running on a loop that allows the user to 
keep selecting between functions, until they chose to exit the program 
all together.  This process is then assisted by the functions, in which 
each operation is organized.  The data is strored in a .h file that is 
called at the beginging with the libraries.  The output of the program 
was checked, using the actual values of win - loss record over time.  

Note: ran out of time to get the last two fucntions to work properly, 
though the search worst records would function similiarly, in concept to 
the search worst records. The first three functions though should 
operate correctly with regards to ndfootball.cpp
