	With regards to the final program, the following is an 
explination.  From the user perspective you are given the function, and the min and 
max that result over the range.  I chose 20 + 15sin(x).  I found sin was 
an interesting function becuase intially there was a negative part of 
the graph.  This meant that the min did not appear on the graph.  I had 
to then shift the graph up so that it min would be both numerically and 
visually relevant.
	
	The inner workings of the plot are based around a nested for 
loop.  The outside for loop cylces through the values, and then creates 
a value d which is an integer that keeps track of y, or in the user 
sense, how far the "&" should be printed.  The nested loop then prints 
in accordance with d, not y.  This is becuase you couldnt have 0.467 of 
an &, for example, so the value has to be trunkated into an integer.  
This print action is then coupled with the min and max inside the for 
loop.  They simply check each value to see if they have a new max or min 
and if they do replace the old value with the new one.
