Part 3 of the lab is designed to return the area of a trapeziod given the 
length of the base, top, and hieght of the shape.  From a programmers 
perspective the varaibles required are all set up as floats as to 
accomidate for non-integer values.  Then the user is promted for inputs. The 
computer then checks the values to see if they are negative, since you can't
have a negative side value.  This would also greatly effect the computation. 
If the "if" loop sees a negative it returns an error message.  If the values
pass the loop then it continues with the formula and then displays the value
calculated to the user.
